A logging plugin for Godot. It allows you log messages and filter them by log levels. You can also format them in several different ways.

NOTE: JLogger was developed and tested under Godot version 4.2.1 stable.

== Installation

There are two ways to install this addon:

* Download one of the https://github.com/JohnDevlopment/godot-jlogger/releases[Releases] and add the `logging` folder to your `addons` folder.
* Clone this repository and do the same.

== Usage

In your project settings, enable the `JLogger` plugin. When it's activated, two singletons and a class are added to your project--`Logging`, `Loggingconfig`, and `Logger` respectively. Additionally, a `logging.cfg` is created in the plugin folder.

Right away, you can use `Logging` to start printing logs.

If you want instance a `Logger`, there are two ways to do it. Firstly, you can use `Logging.get_logger()` to get a `Logger` instance. Secondly, you can use `Logger.new()`, although the former is the recommended approach.

Here is a snippet of doing just that:

NOTE: There is currently no support for logging to files or other external sources. For right now, loggers only print to the console. But since Godot already has its own log files, this is not neccessarily an issue.
